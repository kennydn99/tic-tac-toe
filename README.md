# tic-tac-toe

In this project, I will be creating a Tic Tac Toe game with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I will apply the knowledge I've learned about Javacript function factories.

First, I will create this game in the console then add in a UI. I am looking forward to practicing writing organized and logical code as well as face and resolve any challenges that I encounter.
